            <p id="portfolio summary">Every organism has a "skin". Most have skin that we can see, touch, or even taste. The idea of "stuffing" the skin of an organism to preserve it is called Taxidermy. Taxidermy by Merriam-webster.com is, "the art of preparing, stuffing, and mounting the skins of animals and especially vertebrates". 
                Taxidermy dates back to the Egyptians according to "bonesandbugs.com", "In ancient Egypt, taxidermy was not used as a means to put animals on display, but rather, to preserve animals that were pets or were beloved by pharaohs and other nobility. 
                They developed the first type of preservation of animals through the use of embalming tools, spices, injections, and oils." Taxidermy evolved from something that was noble to everyday practice. Many museums today, use taxidermy to show animals. Taxidermy is also used by many animal owners who
            wish to preserve their precious animals. </p>
